## Challenge Name:

Nissrensics: Vandrestien 

## Category:

Malware

## Challenge Description:

```text
Er du god til digitale undersøgelser, eller synes du bare, det bliver noget nissrensics? Har du styr på alle Windows nissefakterne, eller giver du op efter `strings`?

Start din rejse med en god lang gåtur gennem mit filsystem.
```

The handout for this challenge was a 20 GB EnCase disk image, which is not attached here for obvious reasons.

The challenge clearly hints at digital forensics (“nissrensics”) on a Windows system, with an emphasis on filesystem artifacts rather than quick wins using tools like `strings`.

## Approach 

For disk image and filesystem forensics challenges, I personally prefer [Autopsy](https://www.autopsy.com/) due to its excellent GUI, timeline view, and artifact parsing.

For multi-stage challenges like this one, I always start by manually browsing the filesystem to get a feel for the machine:
* Who is the user?
* What kind of system is it?
* Are there obvious breadcrumbs left behind?

In this case, the image appears to come from a Windows machine belonging to a user named `Nisseya`.

## Initial enumeration

A good rule of thumb in Windows forensics is to start with user-controlled locations, especially:
* Desktop
* Documents
* Downloads
* Pictures
* AppData (often very important later)

Other things of note:
* The disc have both Edge, Firefox and Chrome installed.
* The timeline shows that the order went:
  * Edge - checked their IP (myip.com), downloaded Firefox and installed it.
  * Firefox - browsed around quite a bit more:
    * Loads of christmas related Google searches
    * Russian Youtube music videos
    * Browsed BR.dk (Danish toy store)
    * Created a CTF user at Nc3ctf.dk
    * Downloaded Chrome
  * Chrome:
    * More Christmas related google searches
    * More interactions with nc3ctf.dk

This will probably be relevant in later tasks ;)

While browsing the Desktop, one folder immediately stood out: `Bedstemors fødseldags billeder` (Grandmother’s birthday pictures).

This looked like a deliberate breadcrumb rather than a coincidence, so I followed it.

## Following the trail

The folder contained another folder.
That folder contained another folder.
And so on.

After descending roughly 10 directory levels deep, I eventually reached a file named:

![alt text](images/flag.png)

Inside this file was the first flag.
Notably, the flag was split and formatted in a way that makes it difficult to find via simple keyword searches, reinforcing the challenge’s hint that this was about walking the filesystem, not shortcutting it.

## Flag
```text
NC3{Du_fulgte_stien}
```

## Reflections and Learnings

This challenge serves as a classic introductory filesystem forensics task, and it does a few things very well:
* Encourages manual exploration:
  Rather than relying on automated searches or artifact extraction, the challenge rewards curiosity and patience.
* Reinforces where to look first on Windows systems:
  User folders, especially the Desktop, are often overlooked in favor of more “technical” artifacts.
* Punishes lazy approaches
  The flag placement and formatting intentionally defeat strings, bulk searches, and naive grepping.

Overall, this was a solid warm-up challenge that reinforces a fundamental lesson in forensics CTFs:

Sometimes the intended solution really is just to look around carefully.
